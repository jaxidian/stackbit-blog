    content: >-
      I have been a consultant, contractor, employee, business owner, developer,
      architect, tester, business analyst, systems analyst, change management engineer,
      development manager, project manager, debugger, bug-writer, and a lot more for
      the past couple decades. I've had an empahsis in the healthcare and energy
      industries. I've had a focus on web, cloud, and machine learning technologies.<br/><br/>
      I'm going to talk about some geeky things here. I will sometimes just cover
      the tech. At other times I'll be quite opinionated. I hope you'll be either
      educated or entertained. I hope that some of my experiences can help some of
      your challenges. Cheers!
